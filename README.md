# All about Jira
It's quite fun to interact with [Jira](https://atlassian.com/software/jira) and use available APIs to automate mundane Adminstration tasks to make life easy! I also enjoy tinkering with [ScriptRunner](https://www.adaptavist.com/atlassian-apps/scriptrunner-for-jira/) which is best thing happen to Jira platform IMHO.
